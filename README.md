# Transductive Zero-Shot Learning for 3D Point Cloud Classification


Created by [Ali Cheraghian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QT0EXIkAAAAJ&hl=en) from Australian National University.


# Introduction
This work is based on our [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07161), which is going to appear in WACV 2020. We proposed a novel transductive zero-shot learning approaach for 3D point clouds. 

In the "class_name" folder, the class names of seen and unseen sets from all 3D datasets are shown. Also, the "word_vector" folder contains the semantic word vectors of 3D datasets.
